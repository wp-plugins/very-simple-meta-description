== OTHER NOTES ==
Do not use this plugin in combination with theme/plugin that also contains own meta description function. This may cause a conflict.

This plugin is translation-ready (Dutch, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Serbian translation included). More translations are very welcome! Please send them to: info@guidovanderleest.nl
You can translate this into your own language using for example plugin Codestyling Localization: http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/


== CREDITS ==
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you!
